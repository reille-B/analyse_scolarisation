2454,Headcount (HC) of R&D personnel,"The headcount (HC) of R&D personnel is defined as the total number of individuals contributing to intramural R&D, at the level of a statistical unit or at an aggregate level, during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year). That means headcount data reflect the total number of persons who are mainly or partially employed in R&D. The use of HCs is mostly recommended in terms of exploring, usually in percentage terms, the characteristics of R&D personnel.","OECD (2015), Frascati Manual 2015: Guidelines for Collecting and Reporting Data on Research and Experimental Development.",,,,R&D surveys.,,,,

3197,"Parity indices (female/male, rural/urban, bottom/top wealth quintiles and others such as disability status, indigenous peoples and conflict-affected, as data become available) for all education indicators on this list that can be disaggregated","SDG Indicator 4.5.1: Parity indices require data for the specific groups of interest. They represent the ratio of the indicator value for one group to that of the other. Typically, the likely more disadvantaged group is the numerator. A value of exactly 1 indicates parity between the two groups.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics.,To measure the general level of disparity between two sub-populations of interest with regard to a given indicator.,"Parity index: The indicator value of the likely more disadvantaged group is divided by the indicator value of the other sub-population of interest.  Adjusted parity index: The parity index does not indicate whether improvement or regression is due to the performance of one of the groups.

The default calculation method for the parity index yields an indicator that is not symmetrical around 1 and that has no upper limit. This limitation can be overcome with a simple transformation, by inverting ratios that exceed 1 and subtracting them from 2. This adjusted parity index is symmetrical around 1 and lies in the range 0-2, which makes interpretation easier.",The indicator vales for the sub-populations of interest.,The sources are the same as for the underlying indicators for this goal.,None because the parity indices directly compare two sub-populations of interest.,"The further from 1 the parity index lies, the greater the disparity between the two groups of interest. For indicators that should ideally increase in values (e.g. gross enrolment ratios, completion rates, participation rates, etc), a parity index value less than 1 indicates disparity in favour of the advantaged group and a value higher than 1 indicates disparity in favour of the disadvantaged group. The interpretation of the parity index is the other way around for indicators that should ideally approach 0%, like out-of-school rates.",,"See section ""Calculation method""  Starting in September 2020, all parity indices are calculated with the formula for adjusted parity indices."
